## Data Structure and Algorithms Library

#### How to use it

```sh
cd your_project
git clone https://github.com/haru02w/libdsa.git libs/libdsa
```

then if you are using cmake, copy the following into your `CMakeLists.txt`
replacing < >

```txt
add_subdirectory(libs/libdsa)
target_link_libraries(<your_executable> PRIVATE dsa)
```
